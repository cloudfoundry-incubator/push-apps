# Push Apps

A jar that pushes apps to CF for PCF Metrics. It is configured using a YAML configuration file, and is designed to make
it easy to push a suite of apps and set up related services and security groups as well as running migrations. It was
originally developed by the PCF Metrics team.

## Usage

Call the jar with a `-c` argument specifying the location of the config file.

```bash
java -jar "applications/cli/build/libs/push-apps-${version}.jar" -c config.yml
```

## Configuration

Push Apps is configured using a YAML configuration file. Below is an example.
We will try to keep this up to date, but just in case, you should be able to use
the types in the classes within [`pushapps/config`](components/push-apps/src/main/kotlin/org/cloudfoundry/tools/pushapps/config)
to determine which types are expected for each field, and which are and are not required.

## Development and Debugging

A few notes to help people contribute to this project.

* The [bin](bin) directory contains a couple helpful scripts. `pushApps.sh` will build the
latest version and call the jar, so you can use it like `bin/pushApps.sh -c config.yml`.
`pushAppsDebug.sh` does the same thing, but also attaches to a remote debugger. This is
helpful in debugging problems. Make sure to spin up a remote debugger in Idea for running
this script.
* There is an [End to End Acceptance Test](applications/acceptance-tests/src/test/kotlin/acceptance/EndToEndAcceptanceTest.kt)
that will actually hit a real Cloud Foundry instance. The test will looking for the following environment
variables to determine which environment to hit.

    ```
    CF_API=api.cf.example.com
    CF_USERNAME=admin
    CF_PASSWORD=secret
    CF_DOMAIN=cf.example.com
    ```

This test does not run as a part of the build `./gradlew build`, but will run on CI, and is available via the
`acceptanceTest` gradle task.

### CI

Unfortunately, CI is private and you may be unable to view the 
[concourse](https://concourse.cf-denver.com/teams/main/pipelines/push-apps) pipeline.

Pushing master of this repository will trigger a build. 

In order to update the pipelines, you must have access to private lpass folders and private concourse access.
The script `ci/set-pipeline.sh` will set the pipeline if you have the necessary permissions. 
Any changes to `ci/push-app.yml` should be pushed up to github once you are happy with the pipeline.

Currently, the pipeline is targeted to a denver bbl deployed environment (see `CF_DOMAIN` in the pipeline). 

## Known Issues

The following issues are known and have stories/bugs waiting for them in the backlog.

* Push Apps will automatically retry on 502 errors from CF. There is no limit to the number
of times it will retry, nor is exponential back-off implemented yet.
* There is a bug that causes null integer values (ie. optional integer values not provided in the
config) to be read in as 0s instead of getting the appropriate default.
* If one DB migration fails, Push Apps will not run remaining ones.
